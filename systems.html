 <h1>Conversion Systems</h1>
 <h2>The importance of using systems:</h2>
<p>In the world of computers and digital systems, data is dealt with 
according to a special representation and method. Here we have to
 remember something, that you can fully understand, data about the
 fundamental factors, data that are in the form of strings of zeros
 and ones. Another, it can send information and data into its own 
 language, the information and data can be converted into its own 
 language, and it can be used in processing operations and other
 types of commands that we may ask of it.</p>
<p>In this context, dealing with computers and digital systems 
requires knowledge of certain number systems, which are slightly 
different from the number systems that we deal with in daily life,
 but are related to them, as it is possible to convert from these systems
 to the system that we understand in our daily life, and vice versa as 
 well. The operations that take place within computer circuits and 
 digital systems depend on Boolean algebra, so the numbers that will
 be dealt with must also be subject to the conditions of Boolean algebra,
 and any type of information that is entered into the computer must be 
 converted to formulas that Boolean algebra understands, so that computer
 circuits can Dealing with it, processing it, and then re-transforming 
 it into the pattern that we as humans understand.</p>


<h3>Decimal System :</h3>
<p>The decimal number system is the simplest number system in terms of
 ease of understanding for us as humans. The system of numbers that
 he said in everyday life, to which algebraic operations can be applied 
 in the traditional form: addition, subtraction, multiplication and 
 division.</p>

<h3>Binary System :</h3>
<p>It is the basis of the digital revolution, and the basis of information
 coding systems and all computer processing operations. It is encoded in 
 the binary number system using a series of zeros and ones, so any 
 information is basically converted into the binary number system, 
 and then processed within the computer.</p>
